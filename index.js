//Capture the grid container, input value, clear button, stylesheet root, and mouse position, and capture them in variables

//Make a variable for how many tiles have been selected

//Make a constructor function for the tiles, and make each item a div with a class of grid-tile

//Make a new instance of the tile constructor function, with as many rows and columns as the input says. Make the default value for rows and columns 64

//For each grid-tile, check if it's been hovered over, and if so, call the mouseOverTile() function and pass the event target

//Declare the mouseOverTile() function

//Create a temporary variable for the color of the current tile, which is a random rgb value

//Every time that specific tile is passed over, add 10% black to it

//Add an event listener to the clear button, and call the clearGrid() function

//Declare the clearGrid() function

//For every tile on the grid, set the color back to white
